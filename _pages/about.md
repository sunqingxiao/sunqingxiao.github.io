**Associate Professor**

*Super Scientific Software Laboratory (SSSLab)*

*College of Information Science and Engineering (CISE)*  

*China University of Petroleum-Beijing (CUP)*  

I am an associate professor in Super Scientific Software Laboratory ([SSSLab](https://www.ssslab.cn/)) at China University of Petroleum-Beijing. I received Ph.D degree under supervision of [Prof. Yi Liu](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/2656.htm) and [Asso. Prof. Hailong Yang](https://thomas-yang.github.io/). My research interests include high performance computing, computer architecture, deep learning system and parallel computing. My recent research invetigates performance auto-tuning, GPU architecture extension, runtime mechanism and graph neural network training. I have authored about 20 publications in the leading international journals and conferences. 

I am awarded with ACM SIGHPC China Doctoral Disseration Award (ACM SIGHPC‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰ºòÂçöÂ•ñ) and CCF TCARCH Doctoral Disseration Award (CCF‰ΩìÁ≥ªÁªìÊûÑ‰ºòÂçöÂ•ñ). My papers have been selected as CLUSTER'21 Best Paper Nomination and IEEE Computer's "Spotlight on Transactions". I currently serve as reviewers in the premier journals including TPDS, TC, TCC and THPC.
