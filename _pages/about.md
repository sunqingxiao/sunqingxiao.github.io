**Associate Professor**

*Super Scientific Software Laboratory (SSSLab)*

*College of Information Science and Engineering (CISE)*  

*China University of Petroleum-Beijing (CUP)*  

I am an associate professor in Super Scientific Software Laboratory ([SSSLab](https://www.ssslab.cn/)) at China University of Petroleum-Beijing. I received Ph.D degree under supervision of [Prof. Yi Liu](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/2656.htm) and [Prof. Hailong Yang](https://thomas-yang.github.io/). My research interests include high performance computing, computer architecture, and parallel computing. My recent research investigates task-based runtime system, sparse tensor computation, and deep learning inference. I have authored over 20 publications in the leading international journals and conferences. 

I am awarded with ACM SIGHPC China Doctoral Dissertation Award (ACM SIGHPC中国优博), CCF TCARCH Doctoral Dissertation Award (CCF体系结构优博) and BUAA Doctoral Dissertation Award (北京航空航天大学优博). My papers have been selected as CLUSTER'21 Best Paper Nomination and IEEE Computer's "Spotlight on Transactions". I currently serve as executive committee member of CCF TCARCH, and reviewers in the journals including TPDS, TC, CSUR, TCC, THPC, SUPE, FCS, and 计算机工程与科学.
